# Secret Santa Application

This project has been written, as a response to my second stage interview.

The project is built using the Laravel framework. And that's about all that's required to run it in it's current form.

I wrote most of the code myself. Using ideas that I came across online during my research.

I copied the method to rename array keys from indexed to named keys.
